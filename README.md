Introducing my latest personal project: Project Schedule Management with MERN technology! ðŸš€

I've harnessed the capabilities of MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and added a touch of style with TailwindCSS to create a robust project management solution. Here's a glimpse of what it offers:

ðŸ“Š **Admin User Features** ðŸ“Š
- Create projects with problem statements, SOW, start and end dates, and allocate resources.
- Assign projects to PMO users with an ACTIVE status.
- Track project progress through dynamic Gantt charts and monitor project deliveries.
- Manage project statuses - transition from ACTIVE to CLOSED or SUSPENDED, all with ease.
- Get a comprehensive dashboard view of active, closed, and suspended projects.

ðŸ“ˆ **PMO User Capabilities** ðŸ“ˆ
- Craft detailed Gantt charts, timelines, and update project progress seamlessly.
- Generate insightful project reports for data-driven decision-making.
- Collaborate with Admin users by raising queries for status changes, ensuring a smooth workflow.
- Keep track of your project portfolio on your personal dashboard.

This project has been a labor of love, aiming to enhance project scheduling, streamline communication, and boost productivity. Join me in exploring this innovative approach to project management! ðŸ’¼ðŸŒŸ
